== Bivo

Bivo is a not-for-profit social enterprise that raises funds online and donates them to UK charities dedicated to Human Aid, Environment and Animal Welfare. Funds are obtained using affiliate programs from companies such as Amazon, eBay or Expedia that pay a percentage of the products bought by users referred from the Bivo portal. For example, a user searches for “cellphone” on Bivo and is offered to buy the item from either eBay or Amazon. The user selects Amazon and is redirected to the Amazon website where the cellphone is purchased for, let’s say, £100. Since Amazon offers a 4% referral fee, Bivo obtains £4 pounds which are donated to charity. From each transaction Bivo keeps a 5% to cover maintenance costs and make the website grow.

Charities can register at Bivo and, after they are approved by the Bivo staff, can propose causes which are then voted by the Bivo Community. Causes that obtain most votes are selected by the system and start to be funded by the income generated by the affiliate programs.
